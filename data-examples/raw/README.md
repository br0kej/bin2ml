# Raw Data Examples

This directory contains examples of the raw data generated by `bin2ml` (i.e from the `bin2ml extract` functionality).

| File                 | `--mode` | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test_bin_cfg.json`  | `cfg`   | All function within a target binary including control flow graph level information such as basic blocks and instructions within each basic block.                  |
| `test_bin_cg.json`   | `cg` | Function level call graph information for each function within a target binary.                                                                                    |
| `test_bin_finfo.json` | `finfo` | Function level metadata information for each function within a target binary.                                                                                      |
| `test_bin_xrefs.json` | `xrefs` | Function level xref inforamtion for each function within a target binary. Includes both function calls and data accesses.                                          |
| `test_bin_reg.json`   | `reg` | Function level register access behaviour for each function within the binary. This requires emulation using ESIL - Takes a while on complex functions              |
|`test_bin_localvar-xrefs.json` | `localvar-xrefs` | Function level local variable xref information for each function within a target binary. Includes both read and writes.                                            |
| `test_bin_pcode-bb.json` | `pcode-bb` | Function level pcode (low-level) information where each basic block is represented on its on with accompanying metadata such as start, end, jump, fall through etc |
| `test_bin_pcode-func.json` | `pcode-func` | Function level pcode (low-level) information which is just linear without any basic block informaton. Also contains accompanying assembly.                         |
| `test_bin_decomp.json` | `decomp` | The corresponding decompiled C code for each function within the target binary. Generated using the `r2ghira` plugin                                                 |
| `test_bin_decomp_annotations.json`| `decomp` + `--with-annotations`| The corresponding decompiled C code and the IDE annotations for each function within the target binary. Generated using the `r2ghira` plugin.                   |
